# Contributing to this repository

This tool is focused on providing vocabulary in line with what is required for my child's school work.  I am not interested in PRs for vocabulary.  However if you want to contribute to the interface or improve the way the tool works, then please go ahead.

There's no format specified for PRs, but it would help to describe the purpose of the change if it's not clear from the code.

Please use two spaces for indentation.
